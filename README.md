# RVO2WithAStar

This is a simple project I am making in order to demonstrate how to use RVO2 library with A* pathfinding project in Unity while generating agents
dynamically in the scene. 

I will also post a tutorial post about this here: https://halitanildonmez.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/using-a-path-finding-project-with-rvo2-library/ You can also see there about how to use RVO2 with Unity

End product should look like the following video: https://youtu.be/H4VgtEIZBTQ

# Requirements

In order to use this you need to have the assets for the A* pathfinding project: https://arongranberg.com/astar/download (version 4.1.10)
and the RVO2 C# files from here: http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/downloads/
